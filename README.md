1. Alert Ticket
Welcome to the Alert Ticket repository, where detailed documentation of security alerts and incidents is cataloged. Each alert ticket serves as a record of identified threats, allowing for effective tracking, analysis, and resolution.
2. Security Audit
This repository serves as a comprehensive record of security audits conducted to assess and enhance the overall security posture of our systems. Security audits play a critical role in identifying vulnerabilities, assessing risk, and implementing measures to protect against potential threats. Each audit report provides valuable insights into the state of our security controls, compliance with industry standards, and recommendations for improvement.
3. Cybersecurity Incident Report
This repository houses detailed documentation of cybersecurity incidents, providing insights into the identification, analysis, and mitigation of security events.
4. Incident report analysis
Welcome to the Incident Report Analysis repository, where detailed examinations of cybersecurity incidents are presented. Each analysis offers a comprehensive view of security 
events, providing valuable insights into incident summary, identify, protect, detection, respond, recover and the continuous improvement of security measures.
5. Incident handler's journal
Welcome to the Incident Handler's Journal, a comprehensive repository documenting security incidents through the lens of the 5W approachâ€”Who, What, When, Where, and Why. Each entry provides a meticulous account of incident response activities, ensuring a thorough understanding of the incident's context, impact, and resolution.
6. File permissions in Linux
In Linux, file permissions are crucial for controlling access to files and directories. Permissions define who can read, write, or execute a file or directory. They are represented by a series of letters and symbols associated with each file. Here's a brief overview of file permissions in Linux:
Permission Structure
Linux file permissions consist of three sets of permissions for three categories of users:
Owner (u): The user who owns the file.
Group (g): The group associated with the file.
Others (o): Everyone else who is not the owner or in the group.
Permission Types
Each set of permissions is represented by three characters:
Read (r): The ability to view the content of a file or list the contents of a directory.
Write (w): The ability to modify or delete a file, and for directories, the ability to add or remove files.
Execute (x): The ability to run a file or traverse a directory.
7. Vulnerability Assessment Report
Welcome to the Vulnerability Assessment Report repository, where comprehensive evaluations of our systems' security vulnerabilities are documented. This repository aims to provide a detailed account of identified weaknesses, potential risks, and recommended mitigation strategies.
